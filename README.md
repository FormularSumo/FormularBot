DemoBot is a demolition bot with around 100 lines of code. It always goes for kickoff if closest/joint closest and after that either tries to demo enemies or collects boost.

Both bots require RLBot to work - https://www.rlbot.org/ Within the RLBot GUI you can download the botpack, which contains most of the best bots. The easiest way to run FormularBot is through the botpack.
